3. The tutorials are ordered in increasing difficulty, by platform:
   1. iPhone/iPad
   1. Android
   1. Cross Platform Mobile
   1. Non-mobile Development: MacOS, tvOS, WatchOS (requires at least a RubyMotion Indie License)
   1. Game Development: iPhone, iPad, Android, and Cross Platform
   1. The RubyMotion Runtime itself
4. Tutorials target the lastest stable iOS/Android releases (unless stated otherwise).
5. The [WNDX School](https://wndx.school) (paid) has some more in-depth video courses. Courses in beta are currently free.

NOTE: RubyMotion is currently closed source, but will become more open
with time. These tutorials will give you insight into how RubyMotion
works behind the scenes, and what you'd need to learn in order to work
on RubyMotion (as the source code becomes more open). These are fairly
advanced tutorials, and are not required to build apps with RubyMotion.
